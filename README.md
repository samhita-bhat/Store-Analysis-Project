  - Pivot Tables  
  - Charts (Bar, Pie, Line)  
  - Slicers & Filters  
  - Conditional Formatting 

## Dataset Information

## Questions answered with pivot tables

## Key insights and observations
- The highest sales revenue and the number of orders occurred in **March**. This indicates a seasonal spike, potentially due to promotions, events, or holidays during this period.
- **Women (64%)** shop more than men (36%) and contribute higher revenue. 
- **Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh** contribute the highest revenue.
- The **Adult age group** (35.59%) is the main customer segment, followed by Teenagers (21.13%). 
- **Amazon (33%)**, **Myntra (23%)**, and **Flipkart (22%)** are the top-performing sales channels.
- Majority of orders (**92%**) were successfully delivered, with minimal cancellations/returns.

## Conclusion
To improve sales of Vrinda Store, women customers of the age group (30-49 yrs) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh must be targeted by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.
